#Facial_Emotion_Detection
A set of images for classifying facial expressions

This repository is a dataset of different facial expressions used for 
training machine learning algorithms.

# Structure
There are two directories. The `images` directory contains raw images. These
are unprocessed. The `data` directory contains files specific to training.
Most importantly, this includes the `legend.csv`, which maps an image in the
`images` directory with a facial expression.
